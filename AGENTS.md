# Gemini Project Context: Retirement Ceremony Invitation

This document provides essential context and instructions for AI agents working on the Retirement Ceremony Invitation project.

## Project Overview

A formal, responsive retirement ceremony invitation built with **React 19**, **Vite 7**, **TypeScript**, and **SASS**. It supports event details, an optional photo gallery, venue search links, and Kakao sharing.

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend Framework:** React 19
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7
- **Styling:** SASS (SCSS) with CSS Variables
- **Date Management:** Day.js
- **Icons:** SVG (via `vite-plugin-svgr`)
- **Maps:** Naver Map and Kakao Map search links
- **Social Sharing:** Kakao SDK

## Architecture & Structure

The project follows a component-based architecture where sections of the invitation are modularized.

- `src/const.ts`: **Primary configuration file**. Contains professor, ceremony, schedule, and venue details.
- `src/images/index.ts`: Registers the optional cover and gallery photos.
- `src/App.tsx`: Main orchestrator of the sections.
- `src/component/`: Contains all UI components. Each component typically has its own `.tsx` and `.scss` file.
  - `modal/`: Custom modal management system with focus trap.
  - `store/`: Simple state management for the Kakao SDK.
  - `lazyDiv/`: A wrapper component that adds fade-in animations when scrolled into view.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configured to inject constants from `src/const.ts` directly into `index.html` and `manifest.json`.

---

## Development Workflow

### Key Commands
- `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server (port 3000).
- `npm run build`: Generates the production build in the `build/` directory.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint for code quality checks.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

### Environment Variables
The only optional environment variable is `VITE_KAKAO_SDK_JS_KEY`, used for Kakao sharing. Venue search links work without API keys.

## Coding Conventions & Guidelines

### 1. Configuration First
Always check `src/const.ts` before hardcoding ceremony-related information. New event configuration should be added there to maintain a single source of truth.

### 2. Documentation
- **Korean Friendly:** The codebase is fully documented with Korean comments (JSDoc style). This is intended to help Korean users easily understand and customize the template. When adding new features, please maintain this standard.

### 3. Styling
- **Responsive Design:** Use `rem` units for spacing and font sizes. The root `font-size` is responsive (`4vw` on small screens).
- **Theming:** Use CSS variables defined in `src/App.scss` (e.g., `var(--theme-color)`).
- **SCSS Modules:** While not using `.module.scss`, each component has its own SCSS file scoped by a top-level class (e.g., `.cover`).

### 3. Components
- **Animations:** Wrap major sections in `<LazyDiv>` to enable scroll-triggered fade-in animations.
- **Modals:** Use the custom `ModalProvider` and `useModal` hook (if applicable) for overlays. Modals are managed via a dedicated `modals-wrapper` div.

### 4. Images
- Keep images optimized. Large studio photos should be resized to ~1000px before being placed in `src/images/`.

## Testing & Validation
- Ensure all changes are tested on both desktop and mobile viewports.
- Verify that the venue search links use the configured search query and Kakao sharing uses the current event details.
- If modifying the build process, ensure `manifest-inject` and HTML injection in `vite.config.ts` still function as expected.
